<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#fffff;">
    <p>I’m Claudia Vazquez, I am currently in the 9th grade and enrolled in Math and Science College Prep.I am currently working towards my goal of owning my own restaurant/cafe.Ever since I was little girl I would be in the kitchen cooking with my mother and watch cooking shows. From heating up the tortillas to preparing our family’s dinner meals, I’ve always had a passion for cooking. I plan to finish my high school career at the top of my class, and get into the college of my choice. I have strived for perfection in my grades and social life. I will earn a scholarships or multiple to get money so I can able to have the privilege to attend college. Once I graduated, I plan to enter the army to serve for my country. Since I was young, I have been In Jr.Cadets and Cadets. This is a police program that prepares students in the community for opportunities in life, they also prepare you if you would want to be a police officer or part of the army force.When I enter the army I will only serve for a small amount of time. That way I can get some experience in cooking for a large amount of people and have the support of the government to pay for my education. Once I get out I will buy a small restaurant where I can prepare homemade meals for people to enjoy. As time continues and my business begins to grow I will slowly expand my business so others can enjoy good-quality meals.
 </p>
    <p>Throughout my whole life I have strived to be perfect in both my social and work life. I have won many achievements and work. Ever since, I was young I was interested in the arm forces. My mother put me in Jr. cadets, a program to educated children interested in these specific  career areas. I walked in when I was seven years old, however I was about to graduated to Cadets because the age is from seven to thirteen then you can join the Cadets from thirteen to 20 years old. From Jr.cadets i gained a lot of knowledge and experience where I began to create a passion for it.As I was there I began to ranked up, at eight years old I went to Corporal.Then, Sergeant,Lieutenant,and finally Captain.When I earned the title of Captain I was so proud. I became the first ever 10 year old female captain in Jr. Cadets. I was determined and committed to finish my goals.
 </p>
    <p>In my whole school work, my parents have counted on me to get good grades. I made a goal for myself to get straight A’s. I talked to my teachers, and search all over for opportunities to earn my grades. I worked endlessly to  achieve my goal. In seventh grade was my first time ever to get complete A’s. My parents and I were so proud, from there I have aspired to get perfect grades. From seventh to still continuing have only gotten straight A’s.From there I have also preserved from my social life. I setr many goals and achieved each single one. Such as Student Body president, Cheer Captain,Apart of We leaders,etc. From We leaders we helped our community. We created food and toy drives for all families. We helped clean trash all sidewalks and recycle bottles. We have always try help and better the community that we live in. As Student Body President, I intended to make each student’s voice heard. I listen and create solutions for problems that we had in school.I was taught to be a strong,committed young woman and work for what I want.
